autorole is the bot that facilitates an easy and cool looking way to have optional roles. No commands to fumble around with, no spamming in a roles channel, just react and you got it!

Formatting the emoji/role pairs is easy, and you can edit the message afterwards do add/remove any roles!
Just send the message and it works. No other set up required.

The bot can only interact with roles below its own on the hierarchy, so be mindful its highest role!
